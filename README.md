trimbl - A Triangle music blog aggregator
======
This site pulls stories from 3 very amazing local music blogs: [The Bottom String](http://thebottomstring.blogspot.com/), [CityDaze](http://citydazemusic.com/) and [The Triangle Beat](http://www.thetrianglebeat.com/).

While this was created as part of an entrepreneurship class, it really was just me learning what an API is and how to use some pretty hip tech (Bower, Grunt, Node, Express, Angular, Foundation).

To run locally:

1. Install Node.js and NPM
2. Clone this repo
3. cd into it and run `npm install -d`
4. `npm start` should start the webserver (it'll probably be running at localhost:3000)
